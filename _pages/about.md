Welcome to my homepage! 👋

I am currently a first year **<a href='#'>Ph.D. student</a> at Tsinghua University**, Guangdong, in the **[SSR group](https://ssr-group.net/)** (supervised by **[Prof. Wenbo Ding](https://ssr-group.net/)** and **[Prof. Xiaojun Liang](https://pcl.ac.cn/html/918/2022-04-24/content-3953.html)**).  
My current research focuses on embodied intelligence and MLLMs, with a special emphasis on embodied navigation and embodied foundation models.

Before joining Tsinghua University, I received my M.Phil. in Microelectronics in 2025 from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by **[Prof. Renjing Xu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/XU-Renjing/renjingxu)** and **[Prof. Xinyu Chen](https://soldierchen.github.io/)**. I obtained my B.Eng. in Electronics Information in 2023 from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/), and conducted a research internship in 2023 at the Tsinghua University, under the supervision of **[Prof. Fangwen Yu](https://www.yufangwen.com/)** and **[Prof. Luping Shi](https://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/shiluping/en/index.html)**. I was also a research intern at [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/) and [Xiaomi EV](https://www.xiaomiev.com/), supervised by **[Dr. Xiaoshuai Hao](https://haoxiaoshuai.github.io/homepage/)** and **[Dr. Long Chen](https://long.ooo/)**.

My research interests include:

- Embodied Intelligence
- Embodied Foundation Model
- Embodied Navigation
- Embodied Manipulation
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Model
